some things don't work: specifically, it won't go further than 4 dots in the navbar. I was worried about time so I didn't spend time trying to fix it but I'm sure I could with more time. Also, when you get like halfway through the states and try to go back to the earlier states, the arrows switch from moving the view per "screen" of 3 states to by individual state. I was definitely  a bit rushed so the complete functionality isn't perfect, but from a display perspective I think it matches pretty well.
